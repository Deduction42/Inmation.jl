Roadmap:

1.  Automated removal of "nothing" from the data if !(Nothing<:T)
    - Extend type to be Union{T,Nothing} internally for parsing
    - Run "keepat!" on indices where the value is not "nothing"
    - Return object with original T 

2.  Support querying for Units of Measure

3.  Micrate to JSON.jl v1 
    - Return support for InmationRawHistory <: AbstractVector
